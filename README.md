# amethyst-3d-tutorial

**[NOTE: on hiatus from writing this for now. No ETA on returning. Maybe, maybe not?]**

A tutorial for creating 3D games with Amethyst, in mdbook format.

Read the tutorial [here](https://crsaracco.github.io/amethyst-3d-tutorial/)!

The tutorial is still very much a work in progress, and I'm still very much an Amethyst beginner. If you see any typos, anything I misunderstood about Amethyst, or any other sort of error, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. Thanks!
